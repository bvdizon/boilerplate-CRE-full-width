            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Top real estate agents have more local expertise, prepare in-depth market analyses, have superior property marketing, and have high traffic websites that most agents can&rsquo;t compete with. They know South Calgary like the back of their hand and use their market knowledge to sell your home faster than the average agent and for money.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>When you sell a house, your REALTOR&reg; becomes your partner, advisor, and support system. It&rsquo;s crucial to partner with an agent you like and trust. Make sure you&rsquo;re hiring an agent who can answer all of your questions with confidence, and who tells you the things you need to do to get to your goals. Discuss the agent&rsquo;s business and find out how well they know the area, how much business they do, and ask for samples of previous marketing. Ask questions that signal experience, expertise in the area, and honesty in their communication. Listing a property takes a lot of work, so you need a topo agent who&rsquo;s got a strategy and system for preparation, pricing, and advertising and who will work with you throughout.</p>

        <div class="accordion-item"><button id="accordion-button-4"><span class="accordion-title">When is the right time to hire a real estate agent in Calgary?</span><span class="icon">&nbsp;</span></button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Its best to call an agent to sell your home within three to six months prior to your list date. When you start talking to an agent several months before wanting to sell, it leaves enough time to find the best agent, be advised of key preparations, and market your home for all its worth, all of which are essential elements in selling for top dollar. Seasonal and cyclical trends in the market can also effect when you want to list, and the typical &ldquo;list in the spring market&rdquo; mentality is not exactly correct. The Group recommends that you talk to one of our REALTORS&reg; as soon as you're thinking of listing your home for sale. Generally speaking, that's anywhere from 3 to 6 months prior to your desired move date.</p>

        <div class="accordion-item"><button id="accordion-button-5"><span class="accordion-title">What is the average real estate agent commission for agents in San Diego?</span><span class="icon">&nbsp;</span></button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>While individual real estate agent commissions do vary, most real estate agents in Calgary work for 7% on the first $100,000 and 3% on the balance of the home sale price. This will typically be split down the middle to be shared between the buyers agent who brings in their buyer clients, and the listing or marketing agent who markets and represents the seller and the listed property. Home sellers in Calgary are fortunate as the real estate fees for selling here are among the lowest in North America, with the typical being a flat 5% and many areas having land transfer taxes on top of that.</p>
